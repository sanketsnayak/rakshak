## About the Project
This project is a real-time web application that combines:
- **Express** for handling server-side routing and API endpoints.
- **Leaflet** for creating interactive maps and visualizing geospatial data.
- **Socket.IO** for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.

The website demonstrates geolocation-based features with real-time updates, ideal for use cases like tracking, mapping, or collaborative location-sharing systems.

---

## Features
- Interactive map powered by **Leaflet**.
- Real-time updates using **Socket.IO**.
- Server-side routing with **Express**.
- Scalable backend using **Node.js**.
- Support for multiple clients to receive live geolocation data.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.
- **Leaflet**: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time web applications, enabling bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
